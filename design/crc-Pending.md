# Pending
**Requirements:** R258, R259, R260, R262, R264, R265, R283, R284, R287, R288, R289, R301, R305, R306, R311, R313, R314, R351, R355

The pending file schema: embeds the markdown base, owns the document, and adds the
queue entry — a view over a heading region, since nothing in an entry is a field a
tool writes into.

## Knows
- its `Doc`, the markdown parser and its contexts
- its entries, in file order, each with its run of nodes and derived values
- the level-2 headings that are not entries, each with its line
- each entry's line at parse time

## Does
- `ParsePending`: parses with the base, walks level-2 headings, and for each whose
  text opens `N.` collects the run to the region's end and derives the values — the
  title from the heading's first emphasis node, read to its own close
- `Entries`, `Entry(id)`, `MaxID`, `Unread`, `Render`; `Unread` also carries every group the
  context reports open at end of input, at its opener's line, last
- reads a `Source:` line as a part or a gap by the word and shape; `Kind` says which,
  `SourceKey` carries either key; a source that reads as neither is `SourceNone` and unread
- `Place(e, pos)`: renders the canonical entry as one synthetic text and `Insert`s it
  before the entry at `pos`, or where the entries end — before a closing rule, else at
  end of file with the separator adjusted, or after the header's rule when there are
  none; refuses a position out of range, and a gap key that is not one gap ID
- `After(id)`: the position following a live entry
- `Remove(id)`: drops the run, splitting a shared tail text at the region's end, and the
  blank line left at end of file — so `Place` then `Remove` is the identity
- re-reads the document from its bytes after every write and re-derives the entries, then
  reads the write back — the placed entry at its position with every field, the removed one
  gone — or panics with `ReadBackError`

## Constraints
- **A view, not a node.** No re-cutting, no compound: the run is the base's nodes and
  the values are read from their bytes at the format's positions
- **Placement is a node placement**, never a byte splice; refused, never clamped
- **A fence is the entry's**, by construction of the base
- **Say what could not be read**: a heading that is not an entry is listed, and so is a
  `Source:` line that names neither a part nor one gap ID
- **The writer emits one form for each kind**; the reader accepts both and says which
