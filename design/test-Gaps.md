# Test Design: Gaps
**Source:** crc-Gaps.md

## Test: the fixture reads as entries
**Purpose:** R330, R331, R332, R333
**Input:** `minispecsdom/testdata/gaps-sample.md`; a document with no section; a document whose only `## Gaps` is fenced
**Expected:** seven gaps `A1,T1,I1,O1,O2,O3,O4`; `A1` permanent, unboxed, at line 13; `T1` with one folded sub-item; `I1` checked; `O1`'s text folded across three lines; `O2` with two sub-items; `O3`'s fenced `O99` is not a gap and its text stops at the colon; the `O5` after `## Notes` is not a gap; nothing unread; byte-exact render; no section and a fenced section both read empty
**Refs:** crc-Gaps.md, seq-gaps.md#1
**Code:** minispecsdom/gaps_test.go
**Alarm:** 1
**Fire alarm:** drop the code-group skip so a fenced bullet is read. Red: `O99` resolves as a gap and the ID list grows.
**Inject:** minispecsdom/gaps.go:Gaps.readItems
**Pulled:** 2026-09-07 — rang, by hand: `ids = A1,T1,I1,O1,O2,O3,O99,O4` and `O99` resolved as a gap; restore byte-clean

## Test: deviations, nesting, and a bare bullet
**Purpose:** R331, R333
**Input:** a section with a boxed `A1`, an unboxed `O2`, an `O3` with a nested `O4`, a second `O3`, and a bare `- reason:` bullet at column 0
**Expected:** one deviation each on `A1` and `O2`; `O4` at depth 2 with parent `O3` and no deviation; `Gap("O3")` is the first and the second carries a deviation; four unread ending with the bare bullet; `Resolve("A1")` refuses with a `DeviationError`; an absent ID is `ErrNoGap`
**Refs:** crc-Gaps.md, seq-gaps.md#1.3.3
**Code:** minispecsdom/gaps_test.go
**Alarm:** 2
**Fire alarm:** key a gap only at column 0, so an indented keyed bullet is a sub-item. Red: `O4` is not a gap and the ID list is short.
**Inject:** minispecsdom/gaps.go:gapHeadRe
**Pulled:** 2026-09-07 — rang, by hand: `the nested O4 was not read as a gap`; restore byte-clean

## Test: Add appends after the last gap, or after the heading
**Purpose:** R334, R337
**Input:** `Add("O5", …)` then `Add("A2", …)` on the fixture; a taken ID; a bad ID; no section; a section with no entries
**Expected:** `O5` sits between `O4` and the blank before `## Notes`, the file longer by that line alone; `A2` follows it with no checkbox; `ErrGapExists`, `ErrBadGapID`, `ErrNoSection`; the empty section gains its first entry directly under the heading
**Refs:** crc-Gaps.md, seq-gaps.md#2.2
**Code:** minispecsdom/gaps_test.go
**Alarm:** 3
**Fire alarm:** insert at the region's end rather than after the last gap's span. Red: `O5` lands after the blank line, directly before `## Notes`, and the placement assertion fails.
**Inject:** minispecsdom/gaps.go:Gaps.Add
**Pulled:** 2026-09-07 — rang, by hand: the placement and permanent-add assertions both failed, `O5` and `A2` sitting after the blank line; restore byte-clean

## Test: Resolve flips the head; Approve rewrites it permanent
**Purpose:** R335, R336, R337
**Input:** `Resolve("O1")` twice, `Resolve("A1")`; `Approve("O3", "A2")`; `Approve("O1", "A3")` on a fresh fixture; `Approve` with a non-A ID, a taken ID, a permanent target
**Expected:** `[x] O1` with the file the same length; `ErrResolved`; `ErrPermanent`; `- A2:` with `O3`'s head text and the fence beneath untouched, `O3` gone; `- A3:` with `O1`'s two continuation lines still beneath it and the file shorter by exactly `[ ] O1` less `A3`; `ErrBadGapID`, `ErrGapExists`, `ErrPermanent`
**Refs:** crc-Gaps.md, seq-gaps.md#2.3
**Code:** minispecsdom/gaps_test.go
**Alarm:** 4
**Fire alarm:** replace the whole body span on approve rather than the head line. Red: `O1`'s continuation lines are gone from the render. (`O3` cannot carry this alarm: a blank line follows its head, so its body is the head alone and the injection cannot reach it — found on the first pull, which stayed green.)
**Inject:** minispecsdom/gaps.go:Gaps.Approve
**Pulled:** 2026-09-07 — rang, by hand, on the re-targeted test: `approve of a wrapped entry` — `O1`'s continuation lines gone; the first pull against `O3` stayed green and is recorded in the alarm; restore byte-clean
