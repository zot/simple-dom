// ReadBackError is what a write panics with when the reader cannot read it back: the
// writer produced bytes its own reader does not see as the write that was asked for. It
// is a library invariant, not caller input, so it is a panic and not an error a caller
// could swallow; a tool recovers it into a refusal naming the file, and the file stays
// untouched because nothing is written until render returns. The message is a crank
// handle: which reader, which write, on which key, what was wanted and what came back.
// It proves the tree describes the bytes as the write intended; it does not prove the
// write addressed the right region, which no re-parse can.
